# Replit Day 7
Today I learned how to use if statements properly for strings and different codes.
order = input("What would you like to order: pizza or hamburger?")
if order == "hamburger":
  print("Thank you.")
cheese = input("Do you want cheese?")
if cheese == "yes":
  print("You got it.")
else: 
  print("No cheese it is.")
elif order == "pizza":
  print("Pizza coming up.")
  toppings = input("Do you want pepperoni on that?")
if toppings:
pings == "yes":
  print("We will add pepperoni.")
else:
  print ("Your pizza will not have pepperoni.")
