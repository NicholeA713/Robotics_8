Today, I learned how to input and paste each variable.
food = ("Name a food: ")
plant = input ("Name a type of plant: ")
cooking = input ("Name a method of cooking: ")       
food = input ("What word describes burned food?: ")
DIY = input (" Name a DIY item: ")

print (" MENU")
print (food, "with", plant, "on a bed of", DIY)
