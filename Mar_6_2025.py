Today, I learned how to apply double equal signs, and put two strings together as a group, by indenting it.
characterWhich = input ( """"Which character would you be in my world?A wizard, a knight, or a warrior? """)
if characterWhich == "Knight":
  print ("You are a knight, you are a brave and strong person")
if characterWhich == "Wizard":
  print ("You are a wizard, you are a wise and intelligent person")
if characterWhich == "Warrior":
  print ("You are a warrior, you are always in battle, mentally and physically")
else:
  print ("You are a peasant, didn't even choose one of my options. ")
