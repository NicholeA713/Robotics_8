# Replit Day 6
Today, I learned how to use the code elif, which stands for "else if". I used it for when a user is inputting a code, it has to follow one of the three options I coded into the main.py.
season = input("what is your favorite season?")
if season == "spring":
  print("Ah! The birds are chirping and flowers blooming.")
elif season == "summer":
  print("Catch some sun and cool off with a lemonade.")
elif season == "autumn":
  print("The leaves are changing and the air is crisp. Enjoy!")
elif season == "winter":
  print("Stay warm by the fire and watch the snow fall.")
else: 
  print("I don't know that season. Please try again.")
